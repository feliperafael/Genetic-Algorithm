# GeneticAlgorithm

Genetic algorithm implemented in C++ object-oriented<br>
Project uses IDE codeblocks
<br>
<b>Requirements</b>: Need C++ 11 or higher<br>
<b>How to compile?</b> Open a window in the terminal and execute the make command
<br>
<b>How to run?</b> ./bin/Release/GeneticAlgorithm input/input_file<br>
<b>How is the code organized?</b><br>
<p>The /src is where all the basic source codes of the genetic algorithm are, including abstract classes and default implementations.</p>
<p>The /input is where the input files are dependent on the problem being solved</p>
<p>In the /include folder should be all files added to the basic source code /src or all derived classes implemented</p>
